Reflections from lesson 2 of how to use git and github course on udacity

What happens when you initialise a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When you initialise a repository, you are telling the git vcs that you will be tracking changes in 
this folder. Hence, git will track the history of the files and store them in the .git folder which
is created when you run "git init". You need to do this so that git can start tracking the file 
history!

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you
think it offers?

The staging area is different because it holds potential commits instead of files like the working
directory. It differs from the repository because these are not actual commits but more like 
pre-commits. The advantage this offers is that I can choose which files to have in a commit so that
the commit can reflect a logical change I have made in more than one file. Also, I can add and 
remove files as I'd like which makes the tracking process easier!
